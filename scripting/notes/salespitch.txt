Deathrun Toolkit Base 
=====================

Main features:
* Includes both a queue point- and turn-based activator selection system.
* Players can choose not to be the activator or to receive fewer points.
* Has a menu.
* Uses attributes to mod speed and abilities instead of setting entity properties on every game frame.
* Class abilities can be limited instead of outright disabled.
* Ability modifications aren't applied to both teams in a blanket fashion.
* Team pushing can be enabled when there are few remaining players.
* Supports multiple activators (not recommended).
* Uses a database to store and retrieve player points and flags.
* Prevents the blue player(s) from switching teams or using a kill command.

The use of attributes in setting player speed is advantageous over setting a player's maximum speed on each game frame for a number of reasons:
1. This doesn't necessitate the freezing of players during pre-round time by setting their movement type to 'none'.
2. Abilities which affect movement speed will not be overridden, and nor are logic and properties that are used by the mapper. They will instead scale.
3. It presumably improves performance by an unnoticeable amount.


What this plugin does not support and why:

Glowing outlines.

Flat rate speed modification as supplied.

Melee-only as supplied.

Spy disguise disabling.

Custom weapon replacements.

Console variables can be changed during a game using sm_rcon or SSH. Map config files in tf/cfg can be used to set options for maps. Be mindful that some convars may change or be removed with the plugin's development.

For a description of each cvar, type it into console without a value. For a list of all cvar descriptions type 'find dtk_'.



Requirements
------------

* SteamTools Extension (used to change the game description)

Console/Chat Commands
---------------------

Prepend the command with sm_ to use it in console, or / or ! to trigger the command in chat.

dr, drmenu, drtoggle
	Open the DTK menu to change settings, view and reset points.
points, pts
	Show your queue points in chat.
reset
	Reset your queue points.
prefs [0/1/2]
	Set your activator preference. 0 = No thanks, 1 = Don't make me activator very often, 2 = I like being activator.
	If you use the command on its own it will tell you your current preference.
english
	Toggle using English language SourceMod phrases.
drdata
	Print a list of player points and preference flags to console for debugging.

Admin Commands:

award <player> <points>
	Award a player some points. Awarding them negative points takes them away.
	A player with negative points will have to wait longer until they can become the activator and can't reset their points!
resetdatabase
	Drop the DTK table from the SourceMod local SQLite database. It will be created again when the map changes.
resetuser <player>
	Delete a player's record from the database. The player needs to be connected to the server in order to target them.
	You don't need to do this, it's just for testing.
