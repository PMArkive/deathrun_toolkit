Deathrun Toolkit Base 
=====================

What the plugin does in brief.

In the deathrun game mode, one player is selected as the 'activator' and put on the blue team and the rest of the players are put on red. The object of the game is for the reds to complete a hazard course and have at least some of them survive. The goal of the blue player is to activate hazards to try and kill red players. Deathrun maps have a dr_ prefix. This plugin handles the basic team distribution and activator selection functions and limits certain weapons and player attributes where needed.


Installation and dependencies.

DTK is a drop-in replacement for Deathrun Redux and has the same dependencies, however in this plugin they are optional.

TF2 Items is used to restrict some weapons that can be used to cause trouble and ruin the experience for other players.
TF2 Attributes is used to set the attributes for some weapons to prevent them defeating the object of the game.
SteamTools is used to set the server's game description in the server browser.
Source Chat Relay can be used to transmit messages to your Discord server telling you when the round starts and ends, and who has been selected as the activator, to provide some context to events.


Advantages over older plugins.

Player aspects such as run speed and cloak level are modified by adding TF2 attributes, instead of having their properties set on every game frame. This method does not prevent the map from affecting a player's speed using things like stun triggers, pickups, boost pads etc.
Certain class abilities are limited rather than completely disabled. For example, a spy can cloak for one and a half seconds, and has a regeneration time of two minutes, allowing them to use the cloak to bait or 'juke' the activator.
DTK does not give a player properties such as damage resistance or fall damage negation which prevent a map's mechanics from working properly.
Activator selection uses queue points and falls back to a turn-based system when there are too few players. Players can choose to reset their queue points, opt not to receive any or receive them at a reduced rate.
Optionally prevent the activator from using a kill bind or switching teams while the round is active.
All phrases displayed to players come from a translation file. Translations currently include Turkish and German. The plugin's chat prefix and chat colour can be customised in the translation file.
DTK doesn't require that the map has a tf_logic_arena. Mappers are free to make maps that don't have Sudden Death as a core mechanic. They could for example have dead players respawn in a waiting area, or make a new variant of deathrun that revolves around having lives.
DTK works with maps hosted on and served by the TF2 Map Workshop.
If an activator leaves the server or switches teams during pre-round freeze time, they are immediately replaced by the next player in the queue.
DTK hardly ever displays text on screen using the 'HUD Text' or 'game_text' channels, so a map's own HUD text is very unlikely to be interrupted.
DTK works in Open Fortress, though it has a few bugs.
Health scaling for the activator is handled a bit differently. By default the activator has the same amount of health as a normal player, but in combat mini games the map author can trigger health scaling using logic. The health of the activator is then scaled up to a suitable figure based on the number of remaining red players. Their health pool is increased and contribution from health packs scaled down.
The plugin shows a boss health bar for the activator's health when they are damaged or healed. It automatically hides after there has been no change for a while. If the activator gets overhealed, the overheal amount is displayed as text.


New features in this plugin.

Optionally enable team mate pushaway when there are certain number of players left. Some servers use team mate pushaway to enhance the challenge of a map and encourage patience and team mate cooperation. A lot of players are unused to this and may not like it, so the default value is set to be low.
Player preferences and points are stored in SourceMod's SQLite database. They are purged after one month of no activity from the player.
Optionally display to players the classname (and targetname if it exists) of the entity that killed them. This is useful in providing some clarity of the cause of death on maps with unclear hazards.
When the activator is damaged, their health is shown using the TF2 boss health bar. This is useful in combat mini games.
The plugin has special functions mappers can use to set player properties they don't have access to as standard. They are set and triggered using certain types of logic entity with special targetnames.
A built-in admin command to set the class of a target.

Current limitations.




Plans.






The use of attributes in setting player speed is advantageous over setting a player's maximum speed on each game frame for a number of reasons:
1. This doesn't necessitate the freezing of players during pre-round time by setting their movement type to 'none'.
2. Abilities which affect movement speed will not be overridden, and nor are logic and properties that are used by the mapper. They will instead scale.
3. It presumably improves performance by an unnoticeable amount.

Console variables can be changed during a game using sm_rcon or SSH. Map config files in tf/cfg can be used to set options for maps. Be mindful that some convars may change or be removed with the plugin's development.

For a description of each cvar, type it into console without a value. For a list of all cvar descriptions type 'find dtk_'.



Requirements

Console/Chat Commands
---------------------

Prepend the command with sm_ to use it in console, or / or ! to trigger the command in chat.

dr, drmenu, drtoggle
	Open the DTK menu to change settings, view and reset points.
points, pts
	Show your queue points in chat.
reset
	Reset your queue points.
prefs [0/1/2]
	Set your activator preference. 0 = No thanks, 1 = Don't make me activator very often, 2 = I like being activator.
	If you use the command on its own it will tell you your current preference.
english
	Toggle using English language SourceMod phrases.
drdata
	Print a list of player points and preference flags to console for debugging.

Admin Commands:

award <player> <points>
	Award a player some points. Awarding them negative points takes them away.
	A player with negative points will have to wait longer until they can become the activator and can't reset their points!
resetdatabase
	Drop the DTK table from the SourceMod local SQLite database. It will be created again when the map changes.
resetuser <player>
	Delete a player's record from the database. The player needs to be connected to the server in order to target them.
	You don't need to do this, it's just for testing.
