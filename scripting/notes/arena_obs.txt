Arena Observations
==================

Second health scaling was better but we had lower players.

Game varies by player skill level.

Some classes like Medic may need more health because their attacks aren't very good.

Spy worked for me because I could run to the pickups quickly due to the speed buff.

Overhealing seemed to result in faster deaths for the activator but we didn't play many matches.
