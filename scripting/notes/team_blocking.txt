Notes on Team Blocking
======================

Always test both with puppet bots and TF bots.


mp_teams_unbalance_limit
------------------------

This presents the standard team chooser panel, but one team is blocked.
It's not possible to choose this team using a console command.
Setting it to 1 will always present the Blue team as the only option.
Not recommended unless there are fewer than two participants.
But an effective way to have the game handle teams at low players.


tf_arena_use_queue
------------------

Displays the single door panel but enables the Arena queue.


Can we enable Watch Mode when there are fewer than two participants?

Check out mp_autoteam or whatever it was


Game Bugs
=========

The first round of a map causes two round restarts, so activator selection logic can be triggered twice.
This causes the first selected activator to lose their points and be put on red.
The solution is to not consume points or announce their selection of the round state is 'waiting'.
This is the plugin's own state tracking variable. A round restart sets it to 'freeze'.


Mod Quirks
==========

Open Fortress
-------------

It's possible to stall an active Arena round if there are no live players on either team. 
The round will only restart when one team has live players and the game declares them victor.
Since you can't respawn in Arena, we must check periodically for:
	1. Round state 'active'
	2. At least one participant
	3. No live players on either team
Upon triggering, executing mp_restartgame works in OF Arena. 


TF2 Classic
-----------

Bug: You need a player on each team to start an Arena round. If we're shoving people on red,
we won't trigger a round. This happens during round state 0. The solution is to enable the team
unbalance cvar while there is only one participant to force an incoming player onto the opposite team.

TF2Classic doesn't seem to support mp_restartgame or mp_restartround in Arena.


Player Class Unknown
====================

If an Arena round starts, and a player has joined a team but not chosen a class, they will be stuck in limbo.
They will be 'alive' but not able to play or spawn, and the round will be held up.
Players must be given a class when they join a team if it's freeze time, or on round restart.
Alternatively you can assign them a class when the are put in game or join a team.
