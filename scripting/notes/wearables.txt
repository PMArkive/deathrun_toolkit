Wearables
=========

Mikusch uses an SDKCall to get a wearable index. It uses a virtual function.

I don't want to have to rely on game data so I will find an alternative method.


Research
--------

Searching netprops for 'wearable':

There is a player table named m_hMyWearables. Can it be used like the ammo table system?

The base class seems to be CEconWearable.

Weapons seem to have two properties named m_hExtraWearable and m_hExtraWearableViewModel.


m_hMyWearables
--------------

The table has eight rows (members) which are ints of 21 bits each. Could these be IDIs?
