Restrictions
============


Method
------

Methods of restriction: Replace, modify.
Replace exchanges the item with a class default, while modify adjusts its properties.

Special mode methods: Strip ammo? Nullify healing?

Modifications could refer to a master list of modifications that are different depending on the
level of mobility restriction desired.

Have a list of default replacement weapons for each class and slot.
If a weapon should be replaced, resort to the default unless a 'profile' is specified.
A profile would be weapon data to use instead of the default, and would be class-agnostic.

May have to have multiple effects based on the mod. These could be subkeys or keys per mod.
Then anything else would be 'shared'.

I prefer to remove weapons rather than modify them as this signifies the weapon is useless.
Modified weapons may not work as expected when used, which could lead to disappointment and confusion.


Key:
	0 - No change
	1 - Limit via modification
	2 - Replace/remove/disable a weapon in that order
	
	
Programming
-----------

Create KV structure globally?

Load the replacements KV into memory on plugin start

Load the restrictions file on configs executed

For loop over the player's occupied slots.
Get the player's weapon index and look it up in the restriction file.
If it exists, get the first sub key.
If attributes, process attributes on the weapon.
If replacement, get the weapon's slot and player class.
Look up the class and slot subkeys in the replacements KV.
Do ReplaceWeapon.


Bugs:
	* As a Scout, my Scattergun replacement is invisible in my hands until I switch to it from another weapon.
