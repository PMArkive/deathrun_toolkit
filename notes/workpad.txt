Map author by Steam ID. Credits

Can spies use dropped ammo boxes from other players to refill cloak?
	Yes 

cvar for game description.

Add a way to return a player's speed to default using map logic. Check cvar values first.

Air accelerate and turbo physics cvars.

Simulate the m_bRegenerating private member variable/player property so we don't give weapons to someone who is regenerating.
We could set the property to true when we receive a class change instruction, or when they spawn.
If we need to give them weapons, we check if they are regenerating. If not, give them weapons. If they are, we add the
weapons to a global dynamic array and check again in one frame, or when the inventory event has been fired.

Separate map instructions to separate plugin.




Play Test
=========






Bugs
====

No boss on first round? Could be caused by wrong state. Oh the teams aren't distributed either.

I somehow broke Arena mode when joining blue when there was already an activator. When the red bot died it didn't end the round.

Found a bug with DTK. If you join a team but don't choose a class, you will still be team swapped.
I was put on blue as the activator and had yet to choose a team, but was only able to spec from the Buzz train on PlayStation
and when I tried to choose a class and spawn after the round had started, the game told me I couldn't change class after the round had started.
	Possible fix: I set a player's class to a random one the moment they choose a team if their class is unknown.

When arriving on the server, if waiting for players time has finished, everyone is forced onto red and a round start event is never called.
	Fixed?

Overheal text remains on screen after blue guy dies.
	Test fix
Max health scale seems to give the activator more bounciness from damage.

Plugin doesn't select health bar target properly. Maybe have a global Player variable called activator.

Max health attribute carries over to next round and when it's removed it leaves an overheal. Need to remove attribute when the activator dies.
	Fixed by using an attribute trigger?
	Update: If using TF2 Attributes we'll need to reset.
	Update 2: Using TF2 Attr and removing all on spawn seems to fix this.

Three people on the server, two decided not to be activator, only one player was being picked by the points system.

If you award points to yourself display a different message instead of two.

Clean up ShowActivity for points award.
	Test fix
	
Opting out should set the points award flag to 0.
	Why? Oh well did it anyway
	
Items created are dropped on the ground when the player's inventory is refreshed.
	Testing m_hOwnerEntity

Can't give a player a secondary weapon if they are wearing soldier boots.
	Test in game
	
FireUser1 from the 'player' doesn't pass the client index as the activator. Instead we get the entity index of the entity that caused the output. e.g. tf_logic_arena.
	Test this in sandbox

I would like some way of delaying weapon grants until after Class regeneration. I don't want to make a requestframe callback function for every function that needs to do this.
	Dynamic array?

Seems RemovePlayerAttribute may not be working! Tried it with the Boost function and it didn't remove the attribute. Need to experiment.
	Could this be caused by the trigger not removing an attribute? Try it with TF2 Attributes enabled and disabled in Sandbox.
	
ChatMessage function isn't showing correct translation phrase when other language clients are on the server.
	Fixed using VFormat

Crappy reply sound in TF2C
	Replaced

TF2C: Spawned into a round in progress during Castle Steveh mini game and kept dying. Need to force a round win if one player.
	Try and emulate TF2 behaviour. See what that game does.

trigger_hurt minus figures doesn't update boss bar
	Check events. Consider hooking player damage/healing instead.

Boss bar shows as full if the activator is killed in one shot
	Write some more debug lines of code to check output. player_death may not be firing after player_hurt.

	This suggests the plugin is doing a spawn check when a player leaves. Check events.

Need a 'reply to command' console respons for my chat stocks.

Anti backstab didn't work after reloading the plugin mid game.

Anti backstab only takes off 100 HP, should be 300.

Check if weapons granted by the plugin are dropped when replaced.

The boss bar sometimes shows an overheal. I switched to Heavy from Engi and it said +175.

On the first round the activator selection systems do not fire.

A player can join blue during pre round time.

Jetpack game gives players the discipilinary action condition.

sm_draward causing exception report? Unknown command: sm_draward

When the player is killed by an obj_sentrygun2, the chat kill feed should say "an"

Not reverting to the QP system when only two players opt in ??

Possibly TF2C: Sometimes a "health: 0" appears on the top of the screen during the setup timer even when I have activator health bar turned off.

Possibly TF2C but not likely: also sometimes i don't see the boost text as an activator, does this happen when some other text in the map is using the same channel?

From Berke: Boost still sometimes gets stuck on round start(edited) you have to type -speed

Speed boost HUD can go missing for some reason.

On next round, previous activator with max health scale buff has an overheal.
	They must have the attribute at the start of the round.

0.4: Ratio 0.5. Max -1. Four players chosen as activator when there are 9. One activator moved to red but was
not replaced! No debug messages or errors.

ChatAdmins should be yellow or red or something

0.4 I joined red team during freeze time and picked a class. I was moved to spec because I had no class but was still on the leader board as being alive.

0.4 Boost not reset on spawn.



Observations
============

player_initial_spawn fires when the players first joins and lands on the MOTD. Seems to happen once per map/connection.
player_spawn and player_activate happen at the same time as this.

Setting activators to 2 and then slaying myself while on blue crashed the server.

If on a server alone and you spawn into a team then go to spec, the 'waiting' message is shown three times.

Activator can kill themselves with stickies.

'Next activators' shows people in spec.

'Next activators' should show correct order if turn-based system is being used.

A 5144 byte trie is created by morecolors.

Setting a speed attribute on a player using a trigger changes their speed immediately. However, if you remove this attribute
it doesn't reset the speed. When you give a player a speed attribute after they spawn, the effect works, but if you remove it,
the speed change is not lost for some reason.




Activator Selection and Redistribution Notes
============================================

Three functions:

CheckForPlayers
	Called on a new round to check if the teams need sorting.
	Watches teams for changes in case an activator needs replacing.

RedistributePlayers
	Moves everyone to Red.
	Calls SelectActivator functions.
	Sets watch mode on.

SelectActivator
	Finds eligible activators and populates the Blue team with the required amount.

1. Check the number of players. If not enough goto 2. if enough goto 5.
2. Print a message if there are not enough and go into a waiting state.
3. Watch for changes to teams
4. Recycle this function again if teams change.
5. Redistribute.

On round reset > Check players

What is the desired number of activators?
Are there at least 1+desired_activators players?

Yes > Swap people around using whichever system is active.

No > Print "Not enough players" and go on watch for team changes (global var in team_change event)

Need to replace activator if they leave.
When players have been moved, watch for changes. 
If a change occurs, check if we have desired_activators on blue team. If we do, do nothing. If we don't, run Check Players.

Bug:

When using more than one activator and the number of players in game is equal to that and someone leaves blue, teams
will not rebalance because there isn't an branch to deal with the situation. I think I need to come up with a better checking
system set of branches which has fallback for fewer activators than the required. But for now it's best to keep the
number of activators on 1.

Proposed New System
-------------------

On round restart, move everyone to Red.

Get the required number of activators using a separate function that takes into account the cvars and number of participants.

Check if we have enough willing participants.

Use points to populate Blue with activators. Reset queue points on move and take away turn token.
Give blue chosen the Activator flag.

Watch teams for changes. If a player moves from blue and is an Activator, remove their flag.
If the number of activators required does not match the number of Activator-flagged players, address.


Order of Watch Mode
-------------------

Plugin is enabled: Watch Mode on

Team change detected: If Watch Mode is on, check teams

Check Teams
	If Watch Mode is on
		Not enough activators: Get more
		Enough activators: Do nothing
		More than enough activators: Nothing happens
	If Watch Mode is off
		If we have more than one participant: Redistribute
		If we have one or fewer participants, turn on Watch Mode

Redistribute players: After, turn on Watch Mode

Round Start: Watch Mode off
