// How this works:
// When a player is granted a weapon, it is checked against this list.
// If it matches, the specified action is performed.
// You can use the weapon's base classname to match all variants, or the
// 'item definition index' (IDI) belonging to a particular variant.
// The plugin looks for the IDI before the classname.

// What each section does:
// attributes - apply attributes to the weapon to limit it somehow
// replace - replace the weapon with the default in replacements.cfg
// remove - delete the weapon, leaving the slot empty
// 		If a player has that weapon out when it's deleted, they will have no weapon equipped and will A-pose
// 		Use this for utilities in the fourth and fifth slots belonging to spies and engineers
// goto - use another entry in the list for this weapon

// References:
// Here is a list of classnames and IDIs:
// https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Team_Fortress_2_Item_Definition_Indexes

// A note on modifying weapons:
// I believe interfering too much with a player's understanding of how their weapons function causes
// confusion. Rather than making attribute changes to lots of different types of weapons, I recommend
// simply replacing them with a stock or safer variant. If however an entire range of weapons interferes
// with the fundamental mechanics of the game mode (e.g. a rocket launcher by rocket jumping over traps)
// then I think it's fine to modify them because it's in line with the player's expectations.
